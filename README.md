## Introduction

Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate the administrative, clinical, and financial functions within healthcare facilities. On the other hand, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically, promoting interoperability and data exchange between disparate healthcare systems.

This project focuses on integrating HMS with FHIR, allowing for the seamless exchange of healthcare data between the HMS platform and other FHIR-compliant systems. By leveraging FHIR's standardized data formats and APIs, this integration enhances interoperability, facilitates data sharing, and improves the overall efficiency of healthcare operations.

## Features

- **FHIR Integration**: Seamlessly integrate HMS with FHIR-compliant systems for efficient data exchange.
- **Patient Data Exchange**: Enable the exchange of patient demographic, clinical, and administrative data using FHIR resources.
- **Interoperability**: Enhance interoperability between HMS and other healthcare systems, enabling better collaboration and data sharing.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency and accuracy across different healthcare IT systems through standardized FHIR resources.
- **Scalability**: Scalable solution capable of handling large volumes of healthcare data efficiently.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures to safeguard sensitive healthcare information during data exchange.
